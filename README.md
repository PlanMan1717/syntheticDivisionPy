# syntheticDivisionPy

This project aims to bring forth a set of optimized tools to assist in the factoring of polynomials.

## The tools 

Your factoring arsenal contains:

* Rational Roots Theorem 

### 😐 That's all?

Yeah, this project is currently in an ongoing state of development.
Expect more tools in the near future! 😃 

## Some thoughts

* Maybe we offer a configurable pipeline to customize the factoring methods?
* Maybe we add support for funtion composition as well?
* Maybe we offer support for complex number results?
